1.  Consider the following information:

{\em ``If Superman were able and willing to prevent evil,
he would do so. If Superman were unable to prevent evil, he
would be impotent; if he were unwilling to prevent evil, he
would be malevolent. Superman does not prevent evil. If
Superman exists, he is neither impotent nor malevolent."}\\

\noindent (a) Represent this information in propositional logic.\\
(b) Explain what it means in relation to (a) that {\em ``Superman does not exist"} \ follows as a consequence.\\
(c) Use Otter to establish (b), explaining your methodology first. \\

\comlb{Notice that the statement of the problems MUST be included before your solution. Not following the instructions will make you lose
points.}


\begin{figure}[h]

\end{center}
\end{figure}

\comlb{Only computer generated figures are allowed. If you have to draw something, you can use MS PowerPoint, etc. (nothing sophisticated will be needed).}


\noindent {\bf Solution:} \ (a)  We introduce the following ``propositional variables", with the following
intended meanings: \ \ (cf. Figure \ref{fig:sup})

\begin{itemize}
\item[$a$:]~ {\em Superman is able to prevent evil}
\item[$w$:]~ {\em Superman is willing to prevent evil}
\item[$i$:]~ {\em Superman is impotent}
\item[$m$:]~ {\em Superman is malevolent}
\item[$p$:]~ {\em Superman prevents evil}
\item[$e$:]~ {\em Superman exists}
\end{itemize}
Now, the given information can be represented by means of the following set of propositional formulas:
\begin{itemize}
\item[$\varphi_0$:]~ ${(a \wedge w) \rightarrow p}$.

 Meaning: ``If Superman is able to prevent evil and is willing, then Superman prevents evil"
\item[$\varphi_1$:]~ ${(\neg a \rightarrow i) \wedge (\neg w
    \rightarrow m)}$

     Meaning: Etc.
\item[$\varphi_2$:]~ ${\neg p}$

 Meaning: Etc.
\item[$\varphi_3$:]~ ${e \rightarrow (\neg i \wedge \neg m)}$

 Meaning: Etc.
\end{itemize}
(b) We have to prove that $\neg e$ is a consequence of $\varphi_0, \ldots, \varphi_3$.\\

\noindent
(c) We do this by contradiction, establishing by means of Otter that the set of formulas: \ $\{\varphi_0, \ldots, \varphi_3, \neg \neg e\}$ is contradictory.

For this, $\varphi_0, \ldots, \varphi_3$ go into the ``usable" list, and $e$ goes into the ``sos" list.\\

\comlb{Notice from above that before you do anything with the automated reasoner, you have to explain what you will do and why.} 

\comlb{Below you have to include the main parts of your input/output files. The complete files have to be provided as appendices, not here.}

The main part of the input file, ``sup.in" (attached) is as follows:

{\small
\begin{verbatim}
 set(binary_res).

 formula_list(usable).
 (a & w) -> p.
 (-a -> i) & (-w -> m).
 -p.
 e -> (-i & -m).
 end_of_list.

 formula_list(sos).
 e.
 end_of_list.
 \end{verbatim}
}

 The main part of the output file ``sup.out" (attached) is:

 {\footnotesize \begin{verbatim}
 formula_list(usable).
 a&w->p.    (-a->i)& (-w->m).     -p.    e-> -i& -m.
 end_of_list.

 -------> usable clausifies to:

 list(usable).
 1 [] -a|-w|p.
 2 [] a|i.
 3 [] w|m.
 4 [] -p.
 5 [] -e| -i.
 6 [] -e| -m.
 end_of_list.

 formula_list(sos).
 e.
 end_of_list.

-------> sos clausifies to:

 list(sos).
 7 [] e.
 end_of_list.
